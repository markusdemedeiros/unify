# TODO
## Updated for version 0.1 -> 0.1.1

## Core functionality
- [ ] Occurs Check
- [ ] Real depth-based union
- [~] Final term rewriting
- [ ] Equality modulo unification variables


## Quality of life
- [ ] Pretty print UnifTerms
- [ ] Pretty print substitutions
- [ ] Refactor: Normalized terms should start at zero

## Testing
- [ ] Bad airity tests
- [ ] Actual substitution/term rewrite tests (with equality modulo univ. vars)
- [ ] Quickcheck tests for simple cases in deep trees (ie. self equality, equality modulo unif. vars)
- [ ] Occurs check/decidability tests
- [ ] Parser for alphabet languages
- [ ] Test with more in-depth languages
